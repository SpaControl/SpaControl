# ESP32 'basic' implementation

This directory contains functionality that builds on top of the core library. For example, it offers functionality related to MQTT, WiFi configuration and connectivity, and so on. For people wishing to deploy their own hardware into their spa pool, this implementation is one good option (the other is the ESPHome implementation).
