# ESPHome implementation

This directory contains functionality that builds on top of the core library, and also makes use of the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) framework. This implementation therefore offers much the same functionality of the 'esp-basic' implementation, except that it does it with an ESPHome flavour. For people wishing to deploy their own hardware into their spa pool, this implementation is one good option (the other is the 'esp-basic' implementation).
